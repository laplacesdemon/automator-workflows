Rename-And-Scale-images-for-iOS
===============================

This is an Automator service for renaming and scaling images to import to iOS/Mac apps.

Here is what it does:

  * Append `@2x` to the filename (i.e image.png to image@2x.to).
  * Duplicates and renames them back to original names and scale them half the size.
