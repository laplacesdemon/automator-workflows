Automator Workflows
===================

Osx `Automator` app is very useful for creating macros and save time. This repo is a collection of the macros that I use. 

I usually create `service` workflows for system-wide services available in `Services` menu. But those files can easily be converted to apps.

Usage
-----

Just clone the repo and link each .workflow file you want to use to `~/Library/Services` folder.
