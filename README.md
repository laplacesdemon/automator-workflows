Automator Workflows
===================

Osx `Automator` app is very useful for creating macros and save time. This repo is a collection of the macros that I use. 

I usually create `service` workflows for system-wide services available in `Services` menu. But those files can easily be converted to apps.

Usage
-----

Just clone the repo to`~/Library/Services` folder, or copy each .workflow file to `~/Library/Services` folder

Rename and Scale Selected Images for iOS
----------------------------------------

  * Append `@2x` to the filename (i.e image.png to image@2x.png).
  * Duplicates and renames them back to original names and scale them half the size.
